# Bitwise manipulation algorithms

The algorithms are implemented for single words and slices of words in the
`Word` and `Words` traits, respectively.

The algorithms are heavily inspired and/or directly taken from Matthew
Fioravante's
[N3864 A constexpr bitwise operations library for C++](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3864.html)
proposal and accompanying library:
[stdcxx-bitops](https://github.com/fmatthew5876/stdcxx-bitops).
